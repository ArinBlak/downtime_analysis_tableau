# Downtime Analysis Dashboard (Tableau Project)

This project uses Tableau to visualize **machine breakdown patterns** in different factories for an imaginary company. The goal is to help identify **which machines at which factories are breaking down the most**, based on their **downtime (repair time)**.

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights:
- Visualizes **total downtime per machine**
- Compares **factories side-by-side**
- Helps pinpoint **problematic machines** and factories with the most issues
- Interactive filters for machine types, factory locations, and time

## 🛠️ Tools Used:
- Tableau
- Sample data in JSON format

## 📁 Project Files:
- `downtime_analysis.twbx` – Tableau packaged workbook
- `factory_downtime_data.csv` – Sample data used in the dashboard
- `dashboard_preview.png` – Image of the dashboard
  
## 📌 Purpose:
This dashboard is part of a data analytics learning project to showcase how business insights can be extracted using visual tools like Tableau.
